# Hero presets (Aegis Hero)

## Usage overview

- **Aegis Hero (Builder)** block is used only to create or edit Hero presets (`aegis_hero`).
- On pages or templates, use **AEGIS Hero Embed** to select and render a preset.

## Why the Builder block is hidden in the inserter

To avoid accidental use on regular pages, the Builder block is hidden from the normal inserter. It remains available in the Hero preset editor, where the template is locked to a single Builder block.

## FAQ

**Q: I can’t find the Aegis Hero (Builder) block in the inserter.**

A: This is expected. Use **AEGIS Hero Embed** on pages, and edit the Builder block only inside Hero presets (`aegis_hero`).
